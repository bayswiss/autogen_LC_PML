# autogen_LC_PML
Auto-generating Locally-Conformal Perfectly Matched Layer for FEniCS. Tested with dolfinx 0.6.0

The file helmholtz_with_pml.py contains all the setting for the simulation of helmholtz equation with a monopole source in the specified location. Run it to start the computation. It will import and use the function PML_Functions() from autogen_PML.py

All the algorithms and the implementation of the Locally-Conformal PML are in autogen_PML.py
