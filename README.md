#### Auto-generating Locally-Conformal Perfectly Matched Layer for FEniCSx. Tested with dolfinx 0.9.0.
The file helmholtz_with_pml.py contains all the setting for the simulation of helmholtz equation with a monopole source in the specified location. Run it to start the computation. It will import and use the function PML_Functions() from autogen_PML.py

All the algorithms and the implementation of the Locally-Conformal PML are in autogen_PML.py

##### Just introduced Releases, which tag will be the same of the corresponding dolfinx version. The old scripts, compatible with dolfinx v0.6.0, can be found here:
